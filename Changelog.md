# Version 5.0.0 (2025-04-17)
- [FEATURE] TYPO3 13 compatibility
- [FEATURE] ext:news 12 compatibility
- [BREAKING] Some Templates and Partials have been changed. See [this commit](https://github.com/cdaecke/md_newsfrontend/commit/069a2ab).

## Migration
If you have changed the following files of the extension, please update your templates accordingly
- `Resources/Private/Partials/FooterAssets.html`: Loading of the JS libraries is now done in the controller
- `Resources/Private/Partials/HeaderAssets.html`: This file was removed and the CSS is loaded in the controller
- `Resources/Private/Templates/News/Edit.html`: `f:section name="HeaderAssets"` removed
- `Resources/Private/Templates/News/News.html`: `f:section name="HeaderAssets"` removed
- `Resources/Private/Templates/News/List.html`: Since we use the `SlidingWindowPagination` from the core now, the template needs to be updated
- `Resources/Private/Partials/Pagination.html`: Since we use the `SlidingWindowPagination` from the core now, the template needs to be updated
