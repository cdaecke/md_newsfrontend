# TYPO3 Extension ``md_newsfrontend``

This extension enables a frontend user to add ``ext:news``-records. Beside adding content for the normal text fields like ``title``, ``teaser``, ``bodytext`` it is also possible to upload an image and a file download as well as selecting a category.

Templates are ready to use with the [bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com/) and icons will be shown, if you have [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) icon set included in your project. Validation of input is done in the frontend, rich text editing enabled for the textarea and a date picker in place for the archive date.

## Requirements

- TYPO3 >= 11.5
- ext:news >= 9.0

## Installation

- Install the extension by using the extension manager or use composer
- Include the static TypoScript of the extension
- Configure the extension by setting your own constants

## Usage

- Add the pluign ``News frontend`` on a page, which is restricted by the frontend user login
- Select a storage page in the plugin-tab in the field ``Record Storage Page``
- Now a frontend user is able to add, edit and delete own records

## PSR-14 Events

Following PSR-14 events are available:

- `Mediadreams\MdNewsfrontend\Event\CreateActionBeforeSave`: Called just before saving a new record
- `Mediadreams\MdNewsfrontend\Event\CreateActionAfterPersist`: Called after a new record was saved (new record Id is available)
- `Mediadreams\MdNewsfrontend\Event\UpdateActionBeforeSave`: Called just before an existig record will be updated
- `Mediadreams\MdNewsfrontend\Event\DeleteActionBeforeDelete`: Called just before a record will be deleted

### Register an event

Add following lines in `Configuration/Services.yaml` of your own extension:

```yaml
services:
  Vendor\Extension\EventListener\MyListener:
    tags:
      - name: event.listener
        identifier: 'ext-mdnewsfrontend/createActionBeforeSaveEvent'
        method: 'enrichNews'
        event: Mediadreams\MdNewsfrontend\Event\CreateActionBeforeSaveEvent
```

Add the class `Vendor\Extension\EventListener\MyListener` with the method `enrichNews` in your extension:

```php
namespace Vendor\Extension\EventListener;

use Mediadreams\MdNewsfrontend\Event\CreateActionBeforeSaveEvent;

final class MyListener
{
    public function enrichNews(CreateActionBeforeSaveEvent $obj)
    {
        // Get news object
        $news = $obj->getNews();
        $news->setTeaser('Set some teaser...');

        // Get NewsController
        $newsController = $obj->getNewsController();
    }
}

```
